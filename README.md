# OpenCV Pretrained Face Detection Models Benchmark

In this repository, I provide the code necessary to perform face detection with OpenCV pretrained models,
as well as the code to benchmark their performance.

To perform benchmark, run : '''python benchmark.py -d <name of the detector> -i <path to image dir> -p <path to prediction dir> -g <path to dir where ground truth are stored>

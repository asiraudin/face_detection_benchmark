# OpenCV Pretrained Face Detection Models Benchmark

In this repository, I provide the code necessary to perform face detection with OpenCV pretrained models,
as well as the code to benchmark their performance.

To perform benchmark, run : ```python benchmark.py -d name_of_detector -i path_to_image_dir -p path_to_prediction_dir -g path_to_dir_where_ground_truth_are_stored```
